This fork removed most options from small arms, limiting cannons and rockets to 1 warhead options.
And adding 100 kt + shells for artillery.
Reason: artillery shells work with Ballistic Missile mod but regular warheads do not. Also lowered the cost of researching artillery.

Additional change: californiation renamed to Plutonium-C.
